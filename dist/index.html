<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Motivation</h2>
<p>Nowadays it is rare to find someone who doesn’t collects data about some kind of things, particularly humans are the targets of choice for the <em>Big Data Movement</em>. But since humans are all individuals, which means we are all distinct from each other - more or less. Some of us are sharing a bit more similarities, but most are much less similar to each other. Since these few similarities are widely shared, they should be less important, because it seems to be intuitively the nature of inflationary occurrence, but instead the opposite happens to be the case. It allows to determine who is part of a subset with a specific, and therefore shared, attribute and who isn’t, in order to relate apparently common known stereo typical patters onto the individuals in that subset just to predict outcomes of the corresponding problem or question. In other words, searching for causation where in best case one might find correlations - or so called <em>discrimination</em>, which</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] refers to unfair or unequal treatment of people based on membership to a category or a minority, without regard to individual merit. <em><span class="citation" data-cites="paper_2008_discrimination-aware-data-mining">[<a href="#ref-paper_2008_discrimination-aware-data-mining">1</a>]</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When interacting directly with each other, discrimination of human beings is still a serious issue in our society, but also when humans leveraging computers and algorithms to uncover former unnoticed information in order to include them in their decision making. For example when granting credits, hiring employees, investigating crimes or renting flats. Approving or denying is all happening based on data about the affected individuals <span class="citation" data-cites="book_2015_ethical-it-innovation_ethical-uses-of-information-and-knowledge">[<a href="#ref-book_2015_ethical-it-innovation_ethical-uses-of-information-and-knowledge">2</a>]</span>, which is nothing but discrimination, but on a much larger scale and with less effort - almost parenthetically. The described phenomenon is originally referred as <em>Bias in computer systems</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="paper_1996_bias-in-computer-systems">[<a href="#ref-paper_1996_bias-in-computer-systems">3</a>]</span>. What at fist seems to look like machines going rouge on humans, is in fact the <em>cognitive bias</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="wikipedia_2016_cognitive-bias">[<a href="#ref-wikipedia_2016_cognitive-bias">4</a>]</span> of the human nature, modeled in machine executable language and made to reveal the patterns their creators were looking for.</p>
<p>In addition to the identity-defining data mentioned above humans have the habit to create more and more data on a daily basis - pro-actively e.g by writing a tweet and passively e.g by allowing the twitter app accessing their current location while submitting the tweet. As a result already tremendous amounts of data keeps growing bigger and bigger waiting to get harvested, collected, aggregated, analyzed and finally interpreted. The crux here is, the more data being made available <span class="citation" data-cites="video_2015_big-data-and-deep-learning_discrimination">[<a href="#ref-video_2015_big-data-and-deep-learning_discrimination">5</a>]</span> to <em>mine</em> on, the chances are much higher to isolate data sets, that differ from each other but are coherent in theirselves. Then it is just a matter of the preceded questioning how to distinguish the data set and thereby the related individuals from each other.</p>
<p>So to lower potential discrimination we either need to erase responsible parts from the machines, therefore raising awareness and teaching people about the issue of discrimination are crucial, or we’re trying to prevent our data from falling into these data silos. The later will be addressed in this work.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Purpose &amp; Outcome</h2>
<p>From an individual’s perspective providing data to third parties might not seem harmful at all. Instead eventually one get improved services in return, e.g. more adequate recommendations and fitting advertisement, or more helpful therapies and more secure environments. That said, though it is a matter of perception what’s good and bad, what’s harmful and what’s an advantage. Computing data to leverage decision making is essentially just science and technology and it’s up to the humans how such tools are getting utilized and what purposes they are serving. Hence it should be decided by the data creators, how their data get processed and what parts of them are used.</p>
<p>To tackle the described issue the initial idea here is (1) to equip individuals with the ability to control and maintain their entire data distribution and (2) thus reducing the amount of <em>potentially discriminatory</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="paper_2008_discrimination-aware-data-mining">[<a href="#ref-paper_2008_discrimination-aware-data-mining">1</a>]</span> attributes leaking into arbitrary calculations. To do so people need a reliable and trustworthy tool, which assists them in managing all their <em>personal data</em> and making them accessible for 3rd parties but under their own conditions. After getting permission granted these data consumers might have the most accurate and reliable one-stop resource to an individuals’s data at hand, while urged to respect their privacy at the same time. However this also comes with downsides in terms of security and potential data loss. Elaborating on that and discussing different solutions will be part of the [design process][Design].</p>
<p>The way how to solve the described dilemma is not new. Early days of work done in this field can be dated back to the Mid-2000s where studies were made e.g. about recent developments in the industry or user’s concerning about privacy, and the term <em>Vendor Relationship Management (VRM)</em> were used initially within the context of user-centric personal data management, which also led into the <em>ProjectVRM</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="web_2010_projectvrm_about">[<a href="#ref-web_2010_projectvrm_about">6</a>]</span> started by the <em>Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society at Hardvard University</em>. Since then a great amount of effort went into this research area until today, while also commercial products and business models trying to solve certain problems. For instance concepts such as the <em>Personal Data Store (PDS)</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="paper_2013_the-personal-data-store-approach-to-personal-data-security_2013">[<a href="#ref-paper_2013_the-personal-data-store-approach-to-personal-data-security_2013">7</a>]</span> or a <em>MyData</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="whitepaper_2014_mydata-a-nordic-model-for-human-centered-personal-data-management-and-processing">[<a href="#ref-whitepaper_2014_mydata-a-nordic-model-for-human-centered-personal-data-management-and-processing">8</a>]</span> implementation called <em>Meeco</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="web_2016_meeco-how-it-works">[<a href="#ref-web_2016_meeco-how-it-works">9</a>]</span>, which will all be covered in a more detailed way within the following chapter.</p>
<p>The work and research done for this thesis will be the foundation for an <em>Open Specification</em>, which by itself is a manual to implement a concept called <em>Personal Data as a Service</em>. Important topics like how the architecture will look like, where the actual data can be stored, how to obtain data from the external API or what requirements a user interface for data management need to satisfy, will be examined. After the thesis will be finished, the majority of core issues should already be addressed and can then get outlined in the specification document. Only then the task to actual implement certain components can begin. The reason for that is, when sensitive subjects especially like people’s privacy is at risk, all aspects in question deserve a careful considerations and then get addressed properly. Thus it is indispensable to put adequate effort primarily into the theoretical work. To be clear though, that doesn’t mean writing code to test out theories and ideas can’t be done during research and specification development. It might even help to spot some flaws and eventually trigger evolvement.</p>
<p>To ensure a great level of trust to this project and the resulting software, it is vital to make the development process fully transparent and encourage people to get involved. Therefore it is required to open source all related software and documents <span class="citation" data-cites="repo_2016_pdaas-spec">[<a href="#ref-repo_2016_pdaas-spec">10</a>]</span> from day one on.</p>
<p>In summary, this document is meant to be the initial step in a development process fabricating a tool to manage all data that defines her identity controlled and administrated by it’s owner, and maybe give her a more precise understanding about where her personal information flow and how this might effect her privacy.</p>

<ul>
<li>big data itself initially can be seen as a <em>huge blob of data</em> containing more or less structured data sets <span class="citation" data-cites="web_2016_oxford_definition_big-data">[<a href="#ref-web_2016_oxford_definition_big-data">13</a>]</span>, whose size might have exceeded the capabilities of retrieving certain information almost only by hand. Such high data haystacks usually come along with new challenges in logistic and resource management, when information retrieval needs to get automated on a large scale <span class="citation" data-cites="web_2016_wikipedia_definition_big-data">[<a href="#ref-web_2016_wikipedia_definition_big-data">14</a>]</span>. Theses practices are commonly referred to <em>Big Data (Analysis)</em> including distributed computing and machine learning.</li>
<li>Big Data, or to be more precise, collecting and analyzing big data, serves the prior purpose to extract useful information, which on the other hand depends on what was the opening question about, but also what data sets the corpus is containing.</li>
<li><p>At first, (A) formalizing question(s) that the results have to answer. Secondly, (B) deciding what data is needed and appropriate and then start collecting. Third, (C) designing data models accordingly and correlate with the data (D) next, analyse and interpret the results. (E) last but not least, make business decisions based und the analyses (<span class="citation" data-cites="paper_2015_big-data-analytics_a-survey">[<a href="#ref-paper_2015_big-data-analytics_a-survey">15</a>]</span> Fig. 3).</p></li>
<li>since quite a few businesses (in terms of purpose or intention) are based around the concept of customers, which are generally somewhat entities consisting of at least one human being. In the context of this thesis, these entities are individuals with a unique identity. And to understand the behaviour, decision making and needs of her customers a vendor, who owns the business, needs to know as much as possible about them, when she wants to know what changes she needs to address in order to move towards the most lucrative business.</li>
<li><p>personal data and information are reflecting all this knowledge. It starts with profile data, such as gender, age, residency or income, goes on with time series events like geo-location changes, or web search history and goes all the way up to health data and self-created content like <em>Tweets</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> or videos.</p></li>
<li>all these classes of personal data hold a major share in the field of big data analysis (TODO: find statistics showing shares of data types/classes/categories, <span class="citation" data-cites="book-chapter_1999_Principles-of-knowledge-discovery-in-databases_introduction-to-data-mining">[<a href="#ref-book-chapter_1999_Principles-of-knowledge-discovery-in-databases_introduction-to-data-mining">16</a>]</span>)</li>
<li>but, depending on the specific attributes, they might be not that easy to acquire. in general most businesses obtain data from within their own platforms. some data might be in the user’s rang of control (e.g. customer or profile data), but most of the data comes from interacting directly (content creation, inputs) or indirectly (transactions, meta information). the level of sensitivity is mainly based on the purpose of the platform (benefit for the user) and what is the provider’s demand from the users commitment (e.g. required inputs or usage requires access to location)</li>
<li>from a technical perspective collecting passively created data is as simple as integrating logging mechanisms in the program logic. since the industry moved towards the cloud<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> most scenarios utilized server-client architectures. Furthermore the <em>always-on</em> philosophy evolved to an imperative state. standalone software is starting to call the author’s servers from time to time, just to make sure the user behaves properly. For browsers it was already a common narrative to make here and then requests to the server - still preventable though, but when it comes to native mobile apps it is almost impossible <span class="citation" data-cites="web_2016_answers-io">[<a href="#ref-web_2016_answers-io">17</a>]</span> to notice such behaviour and therefore preventing apps from doing so.</li>
<li><p>these architectural developments were inducing the gathering of potentially useful information from all over the system on a large scale. Logging events, caused by the user’s interactions, on the client, which then get forwarded to backend servers. Or keeping track of all kinds of transactions, which is done directly in the backend. Before running together in a designated place, all these collected chucks of data are getting enriched with meta information. Finally get stored and probably never removed again - all for later analyses.</p></li>
<li><p>what is the (self-)understanding of such data form within the community</p></li>
<li>earlier in the text a difference was made between actively created and passively created data</li>
<li>based on that one could say <em>profile/account data</em> is actively created, because it got into the system by the user’s actively made decision to insert these information into a form and submit it - for whatever reason. whereas detecting the user’s current location and adding this information to the submitted form is <em>meta data</em></li>
<li>of cause, it is debatable whether these kind of data belongs, in the sense of being the rightful owner, to the user or to the author or owner of the software containing the code that effectively created the data.</li>
<li>maybe personal data is every data/information whose creation (or digital existence) is a direct result of user interaction/engagement?</li>
<li><p>lets have a look into what the rule book says about that –&gt; next topic</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Personal Data as a Product</h2>
<p>…to do what exactly? (NOTE: was previously in <em>Motivation</em>)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If one would ask collectors for their motivation to do so, most likely the answer would be something along the lines of <em>“We want to have a better understanding of our customers”</em>. To do what exactly?</p></li>
<li>To predict what might be the next thing I am supposed to buy Or what things I probably would like to consume but most certainly not yet know of?</li>
<li>Let’s take a look at some examples. An advertising service uses tracking data for targeted advertising. The more data they collect about an individual, the more accurate decisions they are able to make on what ads they have to display are the ones the individual will click on and then will go all the way down to disclose a successful purchase. This makes the placed advertisement more valuable for google and therefore more expensive to the advertiser, because of a high precision. Or a streaming provider content recommendation is also based on heavy user profiling done by looking at her consumption history, tracked platform interactions and probably many more vectors. As always, it depends on the business model, but it seems to be consensual, that it all comes down to improving and enhancing the collector’s product (NOTE: needs at least some empirical evidence), in order to satisfy the customers - and that on the other hand depends on who is seen as customers.</li>
<li>Nevertheless if we change the perspective, a lot of great things can be achieved with the help of myriad of personal data, such as:
<ul>
<li>planing and managing human resources for situations, like e.g. big events where attendees might need some help <span class="citation" data-cites="estimating-the-locations-of-emergency-events-from-twitter-streams_2014">[<a href="#ref-estimating-the-locations-of-emergency-events-from-twitter-streams_2014">18</a>]</span></li>
<li>predicting infrastructure workloads [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7336197/]</li>
<li>making more accurate diagnostics to improve their therapy <span class="citation" data-cites="the-practice-of-predictive-analytics-in-healthcare_2013">[<a href="#ref-the-practice-of-predictive-analytics-in-healthcare_2013">19</a>]</span></li>
<li>finding patters in climate changes, which otherwise wont get revealed <span class="citation" data-cites="data-collection-for-climate-changes_2014">[<a href="#ref-data-collection-for-climate-changes_2014">20</a>]</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>individuals then get in role of selling/offering it’s own data to those who were previously collecting them</p></li>
<li><p>It is all about understanding the human being and why she behaves as she does. The challenge is not only to computing certain motives but rather concluding to the right ones. When analyzing computed results with the corresponding data models and trying to conclude, it is important to keep in mind, that correlation is no proof of causation.</p></li>

<li><p>oAuth (1.0a and 2) requires consumers to register upfront. Since the current flow indicates that the initial step is done by the owner, that would cause an overhead in user interactions. Although the owner already <em>authorized</em> the consumer simply by submitting a unique URI (<code>pdaas-server.tld/register?crt=CONSUMER_REGISTER_TOKEN</code>), of which the <code>crt</code> is considered private. Even though the registration provides the consumer with mandatory information such as a consumer identifier (v1: <code>oauth_consumer_key</code>, v2: <code>client_id</code>) and, depending on the client type, a secret (see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2), this process it is not part the specification (https://oauth.net/core/1.0a/#rfc.section.4.2, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2). This enables the possibility of integrating oAuth into the consumer registration flow by using the <code>CONSUMER_REGISTRATION_TOKEN</code> as oAuth’s <em>client identifier</em>. The lack of credentials (v1: <code>auth_consumer_secret</code>, v2: <code>client_secret</code>) would require transferring the consumer identifier done over a secure channel (e.g. TLS). That would leave <em>oAuth2</em> as the version of choice, since it relies on <em>HTTPS</em> adn therefore makes the <em>secret</em> optional. Where on the other side oAuth 1.0a requires a <em>secret</em> to create a signature in order to support insecure connections..</p></li>
