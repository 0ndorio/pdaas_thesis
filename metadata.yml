abstract: >
            Data is the currency of tomorrow. Organizations, whether in the private or public
            sector, gathering enormous amounts of personal (big) data. This data is harvested and
            incorporated by these third parties, but were created by individuals and therefore
            should belong to them. People depending on all their data. Their identity
            as well as their personality are defined by their personal data.
            Meanwhile data silo operators are hammering onto these haystacks eager trying to
            find any kind of correlations worth interpreting, thereby almost inevitably
            discriminating the rightful owners.
            To reduce the possibility of discrimination only the least amount of data that is
            required should be handed over to the third party. Thus the individual has to be in
            charge of the whole process. A personal data service will empower its user to regain
            full control over her data and facilitates detailed information on every data flow.
            To be able to trust such a tool, the user should be able to look inside. Therefore
            a personal data service has to be open source and developed transparently, which
            then also allows to self-host it.
