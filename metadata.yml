abstract: >
            Data is the currency of tomorrow. Organizations, whether in the private or public
            sector, are gathering enormous amounts of personal (big) data. This data is harvested and
            incorporated by these third parties, but were created by individuals and should,
            therefore, belong to them. People are depending on their data. Their identity
            as well as their personality are defined by their personal data.
            Meanwhile data silo operators are hammering onto these haystacks eagerly trying to
            find any correlations worth interpreting, thereby almost inevitably
            discriminating against the rightful owners.
            To reduce the possibility of discrimination only bare minimum of data required
            should be handed over to a third party. Thus the individual has to be in
            charge of the whole process. A personal data service will empower its user to regain
            full control over her data and facilitates detailed information on every data flow.
            To be able to trust such a tool, the user should be able to look inside. Therefore
            a personal data service has to be open source and developed transparently, which
            would then also encourage self-hosting.
