## Personal Data as a Product

+   *Big Data Analytics* by itself just comprises a structured and technical-aided procedure, 
    serving the purpose of finding invisible information, that might be helpful to make (right) 
    (business) decisions. Though, if one would ask data collectors about their motivation, most 
    likely the answer would be something along the lines of PR phrasing like *"We want to have a 
    better understanding of our customers"*. 
    But to do what exactly? To predict what might be the next thing I am supposed to buy Or what 
    things I probably would like to consume but most certainly not yet know of?
+   Let's take a look at some examples. An advertising service uses tracking data for targeted 
    advertising. The more information they have about an individual, the more accurate decisions 
    they are able to make about what ads are the ones the individual most likely will click on
    and disclose with a successful purchase. As a result this makes the placed advertisement more 
    valuable for ad service and therefore more expensive to the advertisers, because of a high 
    precision.
    Or a streaming provider's content recommendation is also based on heavy user profiling 
    done by looking at her consumption history, tracked platform interactions and probably many 
    more vectors.
    Another example is *Google Traffic* [@web_2007_introducing-google-traffic] 
    [@web_2016_wikipedia_google-traffic], a service, integrated as a feature in *Google Maps*, 
    which is Google's web mapping service. *Google Traffic* visualises real-time traffic 
    conditions, when using *Maps* as a navigation assistant, to provide the user with a selection
    of possible paths, but enriched with duration, that takes such conditions into account. The 
    data, required to offer these information, is supplied by mobile devices, constantly 
    sending GPS coordinates with a timestamp into Google's infrastructure. This, however, only is 
    made possible, because Google's services are widely used in addition to the fact that the 
    majority of mobile devices [@graphic_2016_global-mobile-os-market-share] is driven by Android, 
    an mobile operating system developed by Google, that deeply integrates with it's services.
    For this case the same assertion can be made - the more constantly streaming geo-location data, 
    the more precise the information are about traffic conditions. Since this information demands 
    the real-time aspect, adding time to the equation, add a other dimension of complexity to 
    problem.
    
+   while the impact on our society of this first example group might be doubtable, a change of 
    perspective opens up a different range of application areas. Such as
    
    -   planing and managing human resources for situations, like e.g. big events or emergency 
        situations where attendees might need some help 
        [@estimating-the-locations-of-emergency-events-from-twitter-streams_2014]
    -   predicting infrastructure workloads [TODO http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7336197/]
    -   making more accurate diagnostics to improve their therapy 
        [@the-practice-of-predictive-analytics-in-healthcare_2013]
    -   finding patters in climate changes, which otherwise wouldn't be detected 
        [@data-collection-for-climate-changes_2014].
    
+   Through all these examples, some of them might not necessarily founded on personal data, whereas 
    others primarily depend on them and yet others only implicitly rely on data collected from 
    individuals.
    As always, it depends on the purpose - also known as *business model* - but it seems to be 
    consensual, that it all comes down to improving and enhancing the collector's product 
    in order to satisfy the customers - and that on the other hand depends on what is meant to 
    be the product and who is seen as customers.
    
+   Putting a top 10 list of industries using utilizing *Big Data* 
    [@graphic_2015_applications-of-big-data-in-10-industry-verticals] right next to visualization 
    showing categories of personal data targeted by data collectors  
    [@graphic_2012_personal-data-ecosystem], at least 7 [^industries-as-data-collectors] of these 
    industries can be identified as data collectors, whereas less then a half 
    [^industries-as-data-brokers] are taking part of being a *Data Broker*, but almost all of them 
    are using people's personal data, whether collected by themselves or acquired from 
    *Data Broker*.
    
+   At this point it's save to say, that *Personal Data* is either seen directly as a product, 
    especially from a Dater Broker's point of view, or indirectly due to it's essential part in 
    *Big Data* practices. The former generates direct revenue by selling these data and the latter 
    might affect a business's product quality in a positive manner and thereby increasing 
    revenue as well.
+   At the end it all comes down to understanding the human being and why she behaves as she does. 
    The challenge is not only to compute certain motives but rather concluding to the right ones. 
    When analyzing computed results with the corresponding data models and trying to conclude, 
    it is important to keep in mind, that correlation is by far no proof of causation.
    
    
+   individuals then get in role of selling/offering it's own data to those who were previously 
    collecting them
