## Data



TODO: Technology: *GraphGL* or the *Semantic Web Suite* ???

+   keep in mind to make it all somehow extendible, e.g. by using and storing 
    corresponding schemas


+   NOTE: step numbers marked with a `*` are somehow tasks which are happening in the background 
    and don't require any user interaction
    
TODO: data types
+   missing data types as candidate for a "plugin"/"addon" concept, because not every user might 
have the ability to model data types according to her needs. to have a community for this, were the
best solutions might "win"

+   Modelling
+   Categories (or Classes)
+   Types

+   database requirements

+   data Consumption (data inflow)
    -   how data will get into the system
    -   hwo is the user able to do that, and how does it works
    -   manually and automated

+   history
    -   data versioning
    -   access logs
