## Architecture



+   showing possible directions, e.g.:
    -   cloud or local storage
    -   which components can go where
    -   remote execution, to prevent data from leaving the system



### Overview

+   distributed architecture (e.g. notification/queue server + mobile device for persistence
    and administration)



### Components



### Plugins

+   but for what? and not harm security at the same time?
    maybe just for data types and admin UI to display analytical (time based) data in other ways
+   what about extensions (see iOS 10) to let other apps consume data; only on a mobile device and 
    only if the data is stored there
