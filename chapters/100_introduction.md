## Motivation

+   These days it is hard to find someone how is not collecting data about any kind of things,
    especially humans are preferred targets of the *Big Data Movement*. If one would ask 
    collectors for their motivation to do so, most likely the answer would sound somewhat
    like *"We want to have a better understanding of our customers"*. To do what exactly?
+   To predict what is the next thing I am supposed to buy) Or what things I probably would 
    like to consume but most certainly not yet know of?
+   For example an advertising service uses tracking data for targeted advertising. The more 
    data they collect about an individual, the more accurate decisions they are able to make on 
    what ads they have to display are the ones the individual will click on and then will go 
    all the way down to disclose a successful purchase. This makes the placed advertisement 
    more valuable for
    google and therefore more expensive to the advertiser, because of a high precision.
    Or a streaming provider content recommendation is also based on heavy user profiling 
    done by looking at her consume history, tracked platform interactions and probably many 
    more vectors. 
    As always, it depends on the business model
    
    


+   It is all a matter of individual perception what's good or bad, what's armful or what's an
    advantage. Collecting data and analyzing them is just science and technology 
    It is up to the creators how to use them and for what purposes.
    That said, it also should be up to the data creators, what is happening with their data and
    which of them are used.  

+   Not only when interacting directly with each other discrimination of human beings seems to be 
    still a serious issue of our society, but also when computers and algorithms, controlled by
    humans, get leveraged. It's just happening on a much higher scale and rate with less 
    effort - almost parenthetically.
    
+   good things:
    -   planing and managing human resources for situations, like e.g. big events where people 
        might need some help
    -   infrastructure prediction
    -   make more accurate diagnostics to improve their therapy

+   It is all about understanding the human being and why is she behaving as she does. The 
    challenge is not only computing motives but concluding to the right ones. 
+   correlation is no proof of causation 

+   discriminate humans related to certain data, by interpreting results of deep learning and
    using neuronal networking and trying to extract information out of data bulks

+   The idea here is (1) to make the individual capable of controlling her entire data distribution
    and (2) thus reducing the amount of *potentially discriminatory* attributes leaking into 
    arbitrary data silos. 



## Purpose & Outcome

+   Personal Data Store (aka. Service, Space, Vault, Cloud, Management/Manager), VRM (Vendor 
    Relation Management) aka "CRM upside down"
+   Open Source
