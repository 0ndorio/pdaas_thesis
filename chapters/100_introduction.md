## Motivation

Nowadays it is rare to find someone who doesn't collects data about some kind of things, 
particularly humans are the targets of choice for the *Big Data Movement*. But since 
humans are all individuals, which means we are all distinct from each other - more or less.
Some of us are sharing a bit more similarities, but most are much less similar to each other.
Since these few similarities are widely shared, they should be less important, because it's 
the nature of inflationary occurrence. Instead the opposite happens to be the case. It allows
to determine who is part of a subset with a specific, and therefore shared, attribute and who 
isn't, in order to relate apparently common known stereo typical patters onto the individuals 
in that subset just to predict outcomes of the corresponding problem or question. In other words, 
searching for causation where in best case one might find correlations - or so called 
*discrimination*, which

>   minority, without regard to individual merit. *[@paper_2008_discrimination-aware-data-mining_abstract]*

When interacting directly with each other, discrimination of human beings is still a serious issue 
in our society, but also when humans leveraging computers and algorithms to uncover former 
unnoticed information in order to include them in their decision making. For example when 
granting credits, hiring employees, investigating crimes or renting flats. Approving or denying 
is all happening based on data about the affected individuals
[@book_2015_ethical-it-innovation_ethical-uses-of-information-and-knowledge], which is nothing
but discrimination, but on a much larger scale and with less effort - almost parenthetically. 
The described phenomenon is originally referred as *Bias in computer systems*
[@paper_1996_bias-in-computer-systems]. What at fist seems to look like machines going rouge on 
humans, is in fact the *cognitive bias* [@wikipedia_2016_cognitive-bias] of the human nature, 
modeled in machine executable language and made to reveal the patterns their creators were looking 
for.

In addition to the identity-defining data mentioned above humans have the habit to create more and 
more data on a daily basis - pro-actively e.g by writing a tweet and passively e.g by allowing 
the twitter app accessing their current location while submitting the tweet. 
As a result already tremendous amounts of data keeps growing bigger and bigger waiting to
get harvested, collected, aggregated, analyzed and finally interpreted. The crux here is, the 
more data being made available [@video_2015_big-data-and-deep-learning_discrimination]to *mine* 
on, the chances are much higher to isolate data sets, that differ from each other but are 
coherent in theirselves. Then it is just a matter of the preceded questioning how to distinguish 
the data set and thereby the related individuals from each other.

So to lower potential discrimination we either need to erase responsible parts from the machines, 
therefore raising awareness and teaching people about the issue of discrimination are crucial, 
or we*re trying to prevent our data from falling into these data silos. The later will be adressed
in this work.



## Purpose & Outcome

+   It is a matter of individual perception what's good or bad, what's armful or what's an
    advantage. Collecting, aggregating and analyzing data is foremostly just science and 
    technology. It is up to the humans how such tools are getting used and what purposes they 
    are serving. Hence it should be decided by the data creators, what's happening to their 
    data and what parts of them are used.


The idea here is (1) to make the individual capable of controlling her entire data distribution
and (2) thus reducing the amount of *potentially discriminatory* 
[@paper_2008_discrimination-aware-data-mining] attributes leaking into arbitrary calculations.
