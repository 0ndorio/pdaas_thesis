Conclusion
==========================================



## Ethical & Social Impact (TODO: or "Relevance")



## Business Models & Monetisation

+   possible resulting direct or indirect business models
+   owner might want to sell her data, only under her conditions. therefore some kind of 
    infrastructure and process is required (such as payment transfer, data anonymization, market
    place to offer data)



## Challenges

+   adoption rate of such technology



## Solutions



## Attack Scenarios

+   single point of failure (data-wise),
    -   but considering what data users already put into their 
        social networks (or: thE social network: fb), they/it has already become a de facto data silo and is 
        thus a single point of failure. If that service breaks or get down, the data from all users might be
        lost or worse (stolen). The aspect of data decentralisation achieved by individual data stores can 
        be valued as positive.




## Future Work

+   maybe enable the tool to play the role of an own OpenID provider?
+   going one step further and train machine (predictor) by our self with our own data (https://www.technologyreview.com/s/514356/stephen-wolfram-on-personal-analytics/) 



## Summary

+   main focus 
+   unique features
+   technology stack & standards
+   resources
+   the tool might be not a bulletproof vest, but
