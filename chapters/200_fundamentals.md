## Personal Data in the context of the Big Data Movement

+   difference between users *profile/account data* and their *meta data*?



## Personal Data as a Product

...to do what exactly? (NOTE: was previously in *Motivation*)
+   If one would ask 
    collectors for their motivation to do so, most likely the answer would be something along
    the lines of *"We want to have a better understanding of our customers"*. To do what exactly?

+   To predict what might be the next thing I am supposed to buy Or what things I probably would 
    like to consume but most certainly not yet know of?
+   Let's take a look at some examples. An advertising service uses tracking data for targeted advertising. The more 
    data they collect about an individual, the more accurate decisions they are able to make on 
    what ads they have to display are the ones the individual will click on and then will go 
    all the way down to disclose a successful purchase. This makes the placed advertisement 
    more valuable for google and therefore more expensive to the advertiser, 
    because of a high precision.
    Or a streaming provider content recommendation is also based on heavy user profiling 
    done by looking at her consumption history, tracked platform interactions and probably many 
    more vectors. 
    As always, it depends on the business model, but it seems to be consensual, that it 
    all comes down to improving and enhancing the collector's product (NOTE: needs at least
    some empirical evidence), in order to satisfy the customers - and that on the other hand
    depends on who is seen as customers.
+   Nevertheless if we change the perspective, a lot of great things can be achieved with the help 
    of huge amounts of personal data, such as:
    -   planing and managing human resources for situations, like e.g. big events where attendees 
        might need some help [@estimating-the-locations-of-emergency-events-from-twitter-streams_2014]
    -   predicting infrastructure workloads [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7336197/]
    -   making more accurate diagnostics to improve their therapy [@the-practice-of-predictive-analytics-in-healthcare_2013]
    -   finding patters in climate changes, which otherwise wont get revealed [@data-collection-for-climate-changes_2014].


+   individuals then get in role of selling/offering it's own data to those who were previously 
    collecting them


+   It is all about understanding the human being and why she behaves as she does. The 
    challenge is not only to computing certain motives but rather concluding to the right ones. 
    When analyzing computed results with the corresponding data models and trying to conclude, 
    it is important to keep in mind, that correlation is no proof of causation.
    


## Personal Data as of the Law

+   who is the owner in what situation or under what circumstance?
+   difference between "Personal Data" and the owner of that data?



## Digital Identity

+   identity defining data (e.g. history of personal ID card)

+   with such a system a human being is represented by a non-physical abstraction of herself.
    Which essentially is a list of attributes, that are at least for legal and civil
    administration purposes important. Their values in total are unique and representing the 
    corresponding human. Certain attributes hold unique values within it's own context, for 
    example the *social security number*. 
+   Thus it's not necessary to know the values of all attributes in order to identify it's
    owner
+   therefore its imported to not see it as a reduction of a living individual to some bits and
    bytes
    
+   what will happen with her data service after a person died?



## Use Cases (NOTE: maybe move to 100_introduction)

+   package shipment after buying sth online 
+   social network accessing arbitrary profile data
+   making an online purchase
+   credibility (requesting credit permission) validation by a certain financial institution: 
    accessing arbitrary data
+   patient/health record
+   care (movement) data
