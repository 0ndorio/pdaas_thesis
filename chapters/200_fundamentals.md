+   with such a system a human being is represented by a non-physical abstraction of herself.
    Which essentially is a list of attributes, that are at least for legal and civil
    administration purposes important. Their values in total are unique and representing the 
    corresponding human. Certain attributes hold unique values within it's own context, for 
    example the *social security number*. 
+   Thus it's not necessary to know the values of all attributes in order to identify it's
    owner
+   therefore its imported to not see it as a reduction of a living individual to some bits and
    bytes
