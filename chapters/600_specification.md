+   what does *open* in Open Specification even mean?



## Processes (TODO: find another word; "Protocol flows"?)



## Application Programming Interfaces



## Graphical User Interfaces



## Security

+   the downside of having not just parts of the personal data in different places (which is
    currently the common way to store), is in case of security breach, it would increase the 
    possible damage by an exponential rate
    Thereby all data is exposed at once, instead of not just the parts which a single service
    has stored


### Environment


### Transport

+   https only, but which ciphers?


### Storage

+   how should consumer authenticate?



## Recommendations


### Software Dependencies
