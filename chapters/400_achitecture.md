Architecture
==========================================


NOTE: based on the previous discussion, here we show our results and solutions


## Requirements

### Components



## Possible Directions

+   cloud or local storage
+   which components can go where



## Overview

+   distributed architecture (e.g. notification/queue server + mobile device for persistence
    and administration)

### $componentA


### $componentB



## Security

+   the downside of having not just parts of the personal data in different places (which is
    currently the common way to store), is in case of security breach, it would increase the 
    possible damage by an exponential rate
    Thereby all data is exposed at once, instead of not just the parts which a single service
    has stored


### Environment


### Transport


### Storage


### Authentication

+   how should consumer authenticate?


### Attack Scenarios



## Plugins

+   but for what? and not harm security at the same time
