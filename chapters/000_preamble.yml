abstract: >
    Often data is referred to as *the oil of the 21st century*.  But recovering petroleum
    or coal is governed by certain rules and legislation, while vast
    amounts of personal data are harvested from all sorts of resources with no working restrictions
    or asking for permission. Well air-conditioned data centers are mining around the clock via
    dozens of CPUs. Eager to discover even the tiniest correlations worth interpreting in enormous
    haystacks that are filled with data belonging to millions of individuals, who have no knowledge
    of those computations. But these very computations, and thus their developers, almost inevitably
    and without restraints discriminate against these so called *data subjects*.
    Such practices cannot be accepted because these haystacks contain actual identities of human
    beings including their personalities but still getting recklessly monetized.
    To address this issue and reduce the possibility of discrimination, third parties have to be
    supplied with the least amount of data in order to stay functional. That is, data owners
    must be in charge of deciding which entity has access to what personal data of theirs.
    This project aims to specify a personal data service that empowers its user to regain full
    control over her personal data. It facilitates the regulation of data flows and provides
    detailed information on where the data goes so that a *data subject* can become her own data
    broker.
    In order to trust such a service, the user must be able to look inside and see for herself if it
    behaves in unexpected ways. Therefore the specification and all implementations are being open
    sourced and developed transparently in public, which also encourages self-hosting.
