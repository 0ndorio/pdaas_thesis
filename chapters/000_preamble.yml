abstract: >
    Often data is referred to as *the oil of the 21st century*. Whereas recovering petroleum
    or coal is governed b certain rules and legislation, at the same time however vast
    amounts of personal data is harvested from all sorts of resources with no working restrictions
    or asking for permission. Well air-conditioned data centers are mining to the clock of dozens of
    CPUs. Eager to discover even the tiniest correlations worth interpreting in enormous haystacks
    that are filled with data actually belonging to millions of individuals, who have no knowledge
    of those computations. But these very computations, and thus their developers, almost inevitably
    and without restraints discriminate against these so called *data subjects*.
    Such practices cannot be accepted, because these datasets represent someone's identity as well
    as her personality, but getting recklessly monetized after all.
    Such practices cannot be accepted, for though these haystacks are actually represent identities
    of human beings including their personality, they still getting monetized recklessly.
    To address this issue and reduce the possibility of discrimination, third parties have to be
    supplied with the least amount of data in order to stay functional. That is, data owners
    must be in charge of deciding which entity has access to what personal data of theirs.
    This project aims to specify a personal data service that empowers its user to regain full
    control over her personal data. It facilitates to regulate data flow and provides detailed
    information on where did those data go, so that *data subjects* can become their own data
    broker.
    In order to trust such a service, the user must be able to look inside and see for herself if it
    behaves not as expected. Therefore the specification and all implementations are being open
    sourced and developed transparently in public, which would then also encourage self-hosting.
