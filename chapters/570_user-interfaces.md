## User Interfaces



conceiving visual user interfaces is beyond the scope of this work and the specification. 

+   has to be visual?
+   what about an api? e.g. for third party apps (for operator) - maybe self fulfilling because open 
    source
+   Internal:
    -   UI for Management & Administration
    -   Authentication/login
    
list all different features (w/ respect to the requirements) and give a suggestion on how a solution 
would look like; e.g. graph data structure with accordion menus/dropdowns


+   when a data point is a Date or location, some kind of accuracy should be able to defined (in user interface)



TOD: data Consumption (data inflow)
    -   how data will get into the system
    -   hwo is the user able to do that, and how does it works
    -   manually and automated
